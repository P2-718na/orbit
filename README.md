# orbit
~~This is just a very very simple (also very very shitty code) simulation of a 2d body orbiting around another one~~.
This is a thing I'm building to visualize all sorts of physical and mathematical stuff.

## How to use
You are probably gonna need to install dependencies. Which means:
1) `$ [package-manager] install nodejs`
2) `$ npm install`
3) `$ npm run build`
4) Open `dist/html/index.html` in your browser.
